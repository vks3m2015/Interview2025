why kafka topics have partitions?
- partitions are the core mechanism that allows Kafka to be a highly scalable,
  fault-tolerant, and performant distributed streaming platform

how to maintain order of messages in kafka
-  through the use of partitions and message keys

offset management ??

isr (in sync replica)

retention period ?
The default retention period in Apache Kafka, based on time, is 7 days, or 168 hours. This is configured through the log.retention.hours parameter in the Kafka broker properties.

assignment of data to a specific partition within a topic ?
- using a Key:
  If a message includes a key, Kafka will use a hash of this key to determine the partition
- No Key (Round-Robin):
  If a message is sent without a key (or with a null key), Kafka will distribute the messages across the available partitions in a round-robin fashion
- Producers can also implement a custom partitioner logic. This allows developers to define their own rules for assigning messages to partitions based on specific business logic or data characteristics, overriding the default key-based hashing or round-robin behavior
