NAGARRO
--------------------
1 Qs – Given an unsorted list of repeated elements in an array, Find the element with maximum frequency.
2 Qs- Given a string containing characters and brackets, find if the brackets are paired in the string.
3 Qs- (Little Tricky) Given a set of integers, find the third maximum sum of two elements from the set.
For ex – Array -> 3,6,2,7,8,19,13,5
Max Sum of two elements is – 19 + 13 = 32 , So u need to find the third maximum sum.


1. You’re given a m x m matrix. Write a function to rotate submatrix within the matrix by 90degree clock wise. Function takes x and y as starting row and column coordinate of matrix and N as size of submatrix as argument. Inplace rotation was required. I gave brute force I.e. With extra memory.

2. You are given a sorted array containing both negative and positive values. Resort the array taking absolute value of negative numbers. Your complexity should be O(n) --DONE

Ex. A = {-8,-5,-3,-1,3,6,9}
Output: {-1,-3,3,-5,6,-8,9}
3. Wap to find subsets that contains equal sum in an array:

for eg{1,2,3,4,2}->{1,2,3}&&{4,2}
{1,1,3,3,2,8}->{1,3,3,2}&&{1,8}
{1,3,4,7}->no subset

1. Check if binary conversion of given number is palindrome or not. Ex: 6 (0110) is palindrome.
I used a recursive function for binary conversion and then check for palindrome using a loop. Refrain from using inbuilt functions as they wanna check your logic. O(n) time complexity.

2. Separate 0’s and 1’s in that order from a array of only 0’s and 1’s.
I used partition algorithm (Quick Sort) to do the same. O(n) time complexity.

3. One Sentence (string) is given. find out the words, that has length even and greater than equal to 4 (e.g. 4,6,8.. etc.) and separate them with space.
e.g. Given String : “abcd abc abcde abcdef”
Output: “ab cd abc abcde abc def”
I allocated a new string dynamically, and used two for loops to copy one string to another, adding a space at the middle of the word where word length was >=4 and even. O(n^2) time complexity.

It seems easy but it isn’t. I got to know that this can be minimized to O(n) time complexity in the next round.

Practice all types of array and string questions.

2)getRandom(n) – return the random values in between 1 to n
Told hashmap approach he told if the getRandom() give the same values million of time then its sucks.So I modified my approach and he was impressed.

2) A kind of design question. Given amazon log files of two days.He asked me to find the users who logged in both the days. Had discussion using Hashmap,he want to optimise further I gave solution using trie with little modification in its structure

struct Trie {
    int count[2],
    bool isleaf;
    Trie *child[26];
    Trie() {
          count[0]=count[1]=0;
